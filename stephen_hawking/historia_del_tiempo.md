On chapter one. Science is the continuous search of the human existence. why are we here. for what.
thw theory around the universe have been continuously growing with new theories being more sccurate rhan orevious ones.
theories are valid until an edge case appears and either reject the theory or help improving the theory.
the two core fields are theory of general relativity (gravity and  structure of the universe) and quantum physics (phenomena at extremely small scale)
the current goal of physics is to unify those two theories into one theory that model the universe.
the infinity small and gravity.
Einstein theory of gravity is more accurate than Newton but also way more complex.
reason why Newton's theory is still widely adopted and used being way simpler. (Mercure position prediction measurement delta)

Key words: Aristotle, Darwin, natural selection, 1 billion of billions (24zeros)

auto-critic: retain more names and concepts/ideas. many names and stories have been mentioned that could be added.

chapter 1: read/review understanding/connections and memory

chapter 2 (part 1):
author compare at start Aristotle and galileo vs Newton. Aristotle believed that the default of an object is to not move - be pssive.
and everyone also assumed that time was a fixed variable. ____ proved that speed of light was differeing based on eclipse and time before Newton got to release his book on _____ .
early the author explains how we got the mass and gravetiy wrong. Explaining that the speed at which an ibject falls is the same for every object and that if we have metal and a bag of plume, the reason the metal arrives faster is due to the resistance of air applied to the other. but that two metal of different weights would arrive at the same time because their acceleration is the same and no resistance from air.
its thanks to einstein that the relativity of time entered the equation.
for many pple it, and its the more intuitive. time is the same for everyone. but the relativity explains that different observers can have different impressions of time.
e=mc2 where e is energy, m is mass and c is speed of light.
this early part of chapter two shows how the idea of gravity, mass and time evolved from a baaic idea into the latest mostaccurate theory expalining how mass and speed of light helped us see time as a relstive constant.
what winstein said when he was working at the patent office in switzerland is basically that we can drop the idea of light moving through ether which explains variations with the theory of relativity.

auto-critic: missed some names and ideas. core ideas well understood. would not be able to re-write the diff formulas explained through plain words. Newton wrote Principia Mathematica. he used measurements of Galileo for his laws of movement. chapter explains law of movement and law of gravity. the diff is btw aristotle vs galileo and newton and its that Aristotle believed in a profound state of rest where all things would stay stoll excepr if tgey were by a force of impulsed.
both Aristotle and Newton believed in absolute time. danish Ile Christensen Roemer discovered that the light had a finite speed in 1676 thanks to the observations of the moos of jupyter having irregular spacing of times in appearing and disappearing.
becUse both earth and jupyter are turning around the sun their distance changes. his measurements were off (225k kilometers per second vs 300k real number). he discovered this 11 years before principia mathematica was published by newton which makes it even more impressive.
a real theory of propagation of light did not appeared before 1865 by the british James Clerk Maxwell. the chapter then talks about waves and micro waves.
was a good grasp of core ideas. i can improve on retaining more informations by connecting names and existing knowledge. keeping the sewuence of thoughts with max accuracy and details.
