On chapter one. Science is the continuous search of the human existence. why are we here. for what.
thw theory around the universe have been continuously growing with new theories being more sccurate rhan orevious ones.
theories are valid until an edge case appears and either reject the theory or help improving the theory.
the two core fields are theory of general relativity (gravity and  structure of the universe) and quantum physics (phenomena at extremely small scale)
the current goal of physics is to unify those two theories into one theory that model the universe.
the infinity small and gravity.
Einstein theory of gravity is more accurate than Newton but also way more complex.
reason why Newton's theory is still widely adopted and used being way simpler. (Mercure position prediction measurement delta)

Key words: Aristotle, Darwin, natural selection, 1 billion of billions (24zeros)

auto-critic: retain more names and concepts/ideas. many names and stories have been mentioned that could be added.

chapter 1: read/review understanding/connections and memory

chapter 2 (part 1):
author compare at start Aristotle and galileo vs Newton. Aristotle believed that the default of an object is to not move - be pssive.
and everyone also assumed that time was a fixed variable. ____ proved that speed of light was differeing based on eclipse and time before Newton got to release his book on _____ .
early the author explains how we got the mass and gravetiy wrong. Explaining that the speed at which an ibject falls is the same for every object and that if we have metal and a bag of plume, the reason the metal arrives faster is due to the resistance of air applied to the other. but that two metal of different weights would arrive at the same time because their acceleration is the same and no resistance from air.
its thanks to einstein that the relativity of time entered the equation.
for many pple it, and its the more intuitive. time is the same for everyone. but the relativity explains that different observers can have different impressions of time.
e=mc2 where e is energy, m is mass and c is speed of light.
this early part of chapter two shows how the idea of gravity, mass and time evolved from a baaic idea into the latest mostaccurate theory expalining how mass and speed of light helped us see time as a relstive constant.
what winstein said when he was working at the patent office in switzerland is basically that we can drop the idea of light moving through ether which explains variations with the theory of relativity.

auto-critic: missed some names and ideas. core ideas well understood. would not be able to re-write the diff formulas explained through plain words. Newton wrote Principia Mathematica. he used measurements of Galileo for his laws of movement. chapter explains law of movement and law of gravity. the diff is btw aristotle vs galileo and newton and its that Aristotle believed in a profound state of rest where all things would stay stoll excepr if tgey were by a force of impulsed.
both Aristotle and Newton believed in absolute time. danish Ile Christensen Roemer discovered that the light had a finite speed in 1676 thanks to the observations of the moos of jupyter having irregular spacing of times in appearing and disappearing.
becUse both earth and jupyter are turning around the sun their distance changes. his measurements were off (225k kilometers per second vs 300k real number). he discovered this 11 years before principia mathematica was published by newton which makes it even more impressive.
a real theory of propagation of light did not appeared before 1865 by the british James Clerk Maxwell. the chapter then talks about waves and micro waves.
was a good grasp of core ideas. i can improve on retaining more informations by connecting names and existing knowledge. keeping the sewuence of thoughts with max accuracy and details.

chapter 2 - part 2:
alto nivel las secciones son conceptos relacionados con espacio-tiempo, conceptos de pasado/presente/future desde un objeto con eje de tiempo/espacio.
i learned that the light has a speed of 1 meter per ~0,000000003s. that light is impacted by gravity. the bogger the masses the more influence it has on light.
the twin theory that if a twin lives near the sea and the other in the montain, the brother who lives near the sea will br older that the other brother (slightly). 
but this diff can be augmented if the other brother go to space. we also learned that "un suceso" is something that happens in a specific place in soace and specific moment in tkme. we can identify the exact space with four numbers or coordinates.
concept spce/time is key. the "geodesicas" are the lines that connect directly from point A to B around the earth. it is accepted that similarly light uses similar way of moving.
it seemed that one of the point was that light isnt necessarly straight, it oscilates impacted with other masses.
this chapter seemed to be the foundations of principles in history that led Stphen Hawking and Roger Peurose to develop on the idea that the universe is not absolute/fixed but dynamic.
and that it has a beginning and possibly an end.
Names mentioned: Pointcarré, Einstein, Newton, Roger Peurose (Stephen Hawking partner)

auto-critic: missing dates, transitions from ideas, mental timeline of events, missed Maxwell and Michelson.

chapter 3 - the universe in expansion

A few important names mentioned in this chapter and dates.
remember 1978. hard to keep the names. Friedmann was one of them.
the core idea is very interesting. it shows us how we had early hints that the universe was not static. and that even Einsten had a variable for the universe being static (it has a name).
In reality and theough different measurements through the understanding of the lightjess of stars and planets we can understand if they are getting closer or further away from us.
thats the Doppler effect. but instead of sounds like we know it its a spectrum of light and waves that tells us.
Friedmann has three options for the universe expensio . big crunch which is like bog bang but reversed, continuous expansion or continuous expansion but converging towards 0 without never resching it. always growing.
the author explains thay even if good for science fiction the crunch theory doesnt really make sense.
they've calculated how much shiuld the unvierse avg density or mass to see the crunch theory happening. and we're not even 1/10 courning all the visible stars/planets including black holes.
the author reminds that we cant discard so entities that we cant see and wiuld change that number.
auto-critic: lets improve name and date retention to better articulate story in my head.
how?

the next part of this chaptee shows key actors in demonstrating that a singularity (big bang) is at the start of our universe with a plot twist.
stephen Hawking in 1970 demonstrated that if the general theory of relativity by einstien is correct there is a big bang, and this idea got a lot of push back.
but he also mentions that this is also the same idea that he is now fighring inteoducing quantim physics. mergong the infinitly big and small into one unified theory of gravity.
Friedmann's theory arr important as well as two russian physicists (Klishit something and Kalknikov - trying to remember more names here). 
in 1963 Penrose publish a study that explains that for stars when the gravitation is infinite and the volume goes to 0 this is where a singularity happens (black hole/big bang).
and that its also the start lf time. This is where hawking applied this not to stars but our universe and conclude that ig se revert our galaxy in expansion it retracts which comes back to a singularity described by penrose.
thats how they co-publish in 1970 this theory that got hard reception especially fron the russians (marxism + some general thing they disqgree about)
we also learned more about Hawking's desease and his pursuit of the doctorate just to get married (had supposedly not luch more to live). closes the chapter reminding us how throuvh this thousands of yezrs we've evolved our understanding of the universe, with the major ideas that supports it and introducing the current SOTA of the field and interest of the author.
auto-critic: better job with names and date. moving slower and focusong on underdtanding the ideas is rewarding and helps connecting the concepts. missed some nales that were more difficult. let's consule more, improve retrieval capacity and connectors to rhen abstract again on why it's importznt and to what it connects

finished the prev chapter and in new one.
what we understood from previous chapter is that Einstein theory is "classic". it applies well to the huge but does not work for the infinitly small.
that is why weve seen a shift from mechanics to quantum mechanics. where we have to add unpredictability into the concepts. As an experiment showed, the position and the speed of atoms cant allow exact position and exact soeed at the same time.
the heinsenberg principle: the more precisely you know the position of an atom, the less precisely you cant know its momentum (speed x direction) which foes not apply for classical physics.
we learned that artistotles was using the earth, water, air and fire as fundation of the universe. where earth and water (gravity) and air + fire tends to go upward, expand. not sink.
then from Aristotles Stephen Hawking takes us through time and the conception of atoms.
there has been a debate that universe is composed of atoms forever (invisibile in greek).
only very recently the concept of atom have become tangible (early XXth centry - 1902 maybe).
where we were able to ibserve atoms. then we learned about electrons/protons/neutrons. it has been proven that there is an infinite small.
from my understanding you have protons/electrons/beutrons that are subatomics particles. protons and neutrons are made of quarks ("some of the deepest building blocks of matter").
the you have atoms that are composed of sub atomics particles.
then you have molecules that are composed of two or more atoms.
the quarks have 6 flavors and 3 colors (green, red, blue - not real colors - but labels for the type of charge)
and the flavors are up down strange charm bottom top.
we also learned the the exlusion orinciple of pauli that says fhat 2 similar particles cant exist in the similar state. (1925 and nobel prize 1945)
then we learned about the espin, which is th axis to understand looking from different angles if an atom changes 360degrees or 180 degrees.
we have 0,1,2 and 1/2. 1/2 seems special.
saw that in english its weitten spin*.
just red fhat the oauli principle only impact to fermions.
