thw theory around the universe have been continuously growing with new theories being more sccurate rhan orevious ones.
theories are valid until an edge case appears and either reject the theory or help improving the theory.
the two core fields are theory of general relativity (gravity and  structure of the universe) and quantum physics (phenomena at extremely small scale)
the current goal of physics is to unify those two theories into one theory that model the universe.
the infinity small and gravity.

reason why Newton's theory is still widely adopted and used being way simpler. (Mercure position prediction measurement delta)
