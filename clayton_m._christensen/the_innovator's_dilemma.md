# The Innovator's Dilemma

## Introduction

**Why Great Companies Fail**

The main thesis of this book is that well-managed companies often fail precisely *because* they do everything right. They listen to their best customers, invest in improving their existing products, and focus on high-margin opportunities. Yet these same practices leave them vulnerable to disruptive technologies.

**Sustaining vs Disruptive Technologies**

- **Sustaining technologies** improve the performance of established products along dimensions that mainstream customers value.
- **Disruptive technologies** initially underperform in mainstream markets but offer other benefits (simpler, cheaper, more convenient). They eventually improve to meet mainstream needs and displace incumbents.

**The Dilemma**

Successful companies face a dilemma: the very processes and values that made them successful in sustaining technologies make them incapable of responding to disruptive ones.

- Listening to customers keeps you focused on sustaining innovations
- Disruptive technologies often look unattractive to existing customers at first
- By the time they're good enough for mainstream markets, it's often too late

**Key Insights**

1. Disruptive technologies typically enable new markets to emerge.
2. Companies' resource allocation processes are designed to weed out ideas that don't appeal to current customers.
3. Small markets don't solve the growth needs of large companies.
4. An organization's capabilities become its disabilities when facing disruption.

**The Solution**

Create or acquire smaller organizations that can get excited about small wins and new markets. Match the size of the organization to the size of the market opportunity.

# Introduction
Few companies are referenced in the examples (Sears, Digital, Xerox, Apple, IBM)

"The Innovator's Dillema is intented to help a a wide range of managers, consultants, and academicss in manufacturing and service businesses-high tech or low-in slowly evolving or rapidly changing environments. Given that aim, technology, as used in this book, means the processes by which an organization transforms labor, capital, materials, and information into products and services of greater value."

what I understood:
the book is in two parts. first study the innovator's dilemma of why "successful companies fail" and then how to avoid it.
Mentioned a few companies examples where supposedly they were the "best" at managing and navigating the market, but got disrupted. The framing of technology's value transforming labor, capital, materials, and information into products and services of greater value is key and powerful. There are pillars to the pitfalls companies can make. From not doing enough capital allocation to new incumbents, to understanding that your current clients might not be the targets to new products emerging, to a simple idea that usually new disrupting innovations happened in niche markets or new clients before becoming mainstream and making oler solutions obsolete - because previously it was not working well enough.

personal reflection:
makes me think of adam smith and the value of money and labor. also resonate with this idea that many management books are for "happy times" and not covering the full spectrum of reality. That being to academic and not enough first principles thinking makes you miss the actual trends and economy/market changes to properly allocate ressources and adapt management strategies. Have a framework to detect pitfuls as well as tools to better allocate ressources and think of strategy from first princoples is powerful.

auto-critic: in that brief reflection, connect to quotes, stories, examples, possible writings. Expand your neural network of knowledge to make it easier to create connections. Also be more specific with names, dates and lists of concepts.

what I understood:
the important lessons are that companies need to be mindful of their internal processes, understand when disruption can arrive and allocating ressources and structure/ops to embrace new technologies and markets with the right setup and mindset to win. Not overoptimizing what's working and taking bigger bets with calculated risks in sectors that are early, without historical data and usually in niche without clear ROI or playbook on how to do it.

there are 5 concepts important to remember in this intro:
- companies needs customers or investors for ressources
- small markets don't solve growth needs of large companies
- market that don't exist can't be analyzed
- an org capabilities define it's disabilities
- technology supply may not equal market demand

"It is in disruptive innovations, where we know least about the market, that there are such strong first-mover advantages. This is the innovertor's dilemma."


personal reflection: it reinforces the first principle thinking. Deeply understanding everyone's incentives and goals really help to forsee where emerging technologies and markets can grow. It requires a deep enough technological understanding of the SOTA of latest technlogies as well as a deep understanding of the market and the needs of the customers. The it is clear that even with this vision, it's not enough. To properly execute and align the strategy of the company to be successful at these there are pitfalls that are counter intuitive like the actual capabilities of the company to execute on something new, the lower margins of ROI a big company might need as well as the mindset of inferring solutions for something new with no historical data to analyze. This is interesting because it gives first principles to create strategies that are disruption-proof (if executed well). And that this execution is the hard part but planning accordingly and with the proper training/setup the company have a right to play.


auto-critic: did not connect well the 5 concepts to easily retrieve. Got the major ideas but lacked depth in retrieving to best articulate core principles. the pitfalls are clear - could reflect on how to avoir or specific strategies to attack this issues in real world situations.
