**Title:** Reality Transurfing: Steps I-V  
**Author:** Vadim Zeland  
**Publication Date:** 2016 (English edition)  

**TL;DR:**  
*Reality Transurfing* introduces a model of reality where individuals can consciously choose among infinite possible “versions” of life — what Zeland calls the **space of variations**. Instead of forcing outcomes, one learns to shift attention and energy to align with desired life paths. Key ideas include:  
- Letting go of excessive importance and internal conflict  
- Avoiding “pendulums” — social or energetic structures that drain personal energy  
- Balancing intention and action to move toward desired realities  
- Allowing goals to materialize naturally rather than chasing them  

**Summary:**  
Zeland combines quantum theory, metaphysics, and practical psychology to suggest that reality reflects the state of one’s consciousness. By mastering awareness and reducing emotional excess, one can “surf” life’s variations and create a smoother, more fulfilling experience.

 **Definitions:**
 - **Space of variations:** The infinite possible “versions” of life.
 - **Pendulums:** Social or energetic structures that drain personal energy.

## Chapter 2. Pendulums.
In situations, if you react you end up pushing the pendulum higher and higher. 
You'll probably have noticed that if you respond to an anoying situation with irritation, displeasure or other similar emotions, the situation escalates and more things start to go wrong too. This is the pendulum swinging higher and higher. If you react you are the one pushing it higher. It is more effective to act in the opposite manner. Either not reacting at all or reacting in an abnormal way. For example, if when you find yourself in an unpleasant situation you response with false enthusiasm or waky delight the pendulums will be brought to rest. And you will see that the provocation stop with it.
Earlier we said that the habit of reacting negatively to unpleasant circumstances triggers the pendulum mechanism for capturing thought energy. This habit will fade if you decide to play your own game in which you deliberatly **subsitute negative emotions with positive emotions. Confidence for fear. Ehtusiasm for gloom. Indifference for resentment. Joy for irritation.** Try reacting innapropriatly for small instances. You have nothing to loose. 
Another method is to think about what the person getting you upset needs. What that person is missing. Health, confidence, peace of mind. **What that person you're finding challenging might really need in that moment.**
