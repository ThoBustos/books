**Title:** Reality Transurfing: Steps I-V  
**Author:** Vadim Zeland  
**Publication Date:** 2016 (English edition)  

**TL;DR:**  
*Reality Transurfing* introduces a model of reality where individuals can consciously choose among infinite possible “versions” of life — what Zeland calls the **space of variations**. Instead of forcing outcomes, one learns to shift attention and energy to align with desired life paths. Key ideas include:  
- Letting go of excessive importance and internal conflict  
- Avoiding “pendulums” — social or energetic structures that drain personal energy  
- Balancing intention and action to move toward desired realities  
- Allowing goals to materialize naturally rather than chasing them  

**Summary:**  
Zeland combines quantum theory, metaphysics, and practical psychology to suggest that reality reflects the state of one’s consciousness. By mastering awareness and reducing emotional excess, one can “surf” life’s variations and create a smoother, more fulfilling experience.

 **Definitions:**
 - **Space of variations:** The infinite possible “versions” of life.
 - **Pendulums:** Social or energetic structures that drain personal energy.

## Chapter 2. Pendulums.
In situations, if you react you end up pushing the pendulum higher and higher. 
You'll probably have noticed that if you respond to an anoying situation with irritation, displeasure or other similar emotions, the situation escalates and more things start to go wrong too. This is the pendulum swinging higher and higher. If you react you are the one pushing it higher. It is more effective to act in the opposite manner. Either not reacting at all or reacting in an abnormal way. For example, if when you find yourself in an unpleasant situation you response with false enthusiasm or waky delight the pendulums will be brought to rest. And you will see that the provocation stop with it.
Earlier we said that the habit of reacting negatively to unpleasant circumstances triggers the pendulum mechanism for capturing thought energy. This habit will fade if you decide to play your own game in which you deliberatly **subsitute negative emotions with positive emotions. Confidence for fear. Ehtusiasm for gloom. Indifference for resentment. Joy for irritation.** Try reacting innapropriatly for small instances. You have nothing to loose. 
Another method is to think about what the person getting you upset needs. What that person is missing. Health, confidence, peace of mind. **What that person you're finding challenging might really need in that moment.**

Rent yourself. Do not let the problems ahead of you worry/scare/anger you. There is always a straight forward solution of every problem. Do not accept the appearing complexity.

## Chapter 3. The Wave of Fortune.
When you have a positive event that leads a serie of positive events, you are on a wave of fortune. "golden lifelines".  When a positive event is followed by a negatives event it is a sign that you are not on your path.
You don't have to make a huge effort to get a wave of fortune. Just let it in. Don't get distracted by pendulums. Blue bird metaphor. You don't have to catch it but let it eat in your hand. Just don't make it leave.
**Transmission:** Instead of being manipulated by pendulums, choose ones that benefit you.
"You shift to a different lifeline according the quality of your thoughts."
Transmit harmonuous vibrations around you. Do not look for problems instead of solutions.

## Chapter 4. Balance
"Excess poential is created by mental energy when too much importance is given to a particular object. 

The best principle in bringing up children is to behave  towards the child and not only towards children as if they were guests i.e. giving them attention, respect and freedom of choice. Without creating excess potential and without letting them run the show or make your life a misery. The relationship should be constructed on the analogy that you two are no more than guests in this world.

Whatever happens in life - never scorn anyone. It is the most dangerous  dangerous form of judgment because you find yourself in the shoes of the person you scorned. Destain or judging others for conditions create unbalance forces which will likely come back. Mothing wrong in general love from one self though. If one feel superior - then unbalance is created. Nature is more perfect that the human mind. The wolf don't feel anything for the sheep.
Superiority and inferiority always create excess potential. Open expressions of superiority create people to dislike you. Always create excess potential. Balance forces will come in with a slack.
The analogy of the fly.
Self development is worthfull though. Benefits you.
What matters is how you direct your energy. If your goal is to demonstrate X - you will not make progress and it will be harder.
Most people are unaware of the fact that they have created excess potential and that balance forces exist and so interpret the problem that they face to be the manifestation of some unavoidable dark force. You can remove yourself from the majority of your problems if you relieve yourself of the colossal effort of supporting excess potential.
Majority of experiences are happening by the excess potential of yourself or the people around you. Remove yourself from generating excess potential.
Let go of any lurking idea that you are able to manipulate the world around you - things will go wrong.
Your faith is in your hand - but you CHOOSE instead of CHANGING reality.
Self importance triggers pendulums in one way or the other.
The excessiv potential of importance dissipate with action.Do not think, act. If you can not act - do not think about it at all.
